Online beer shop application (web-application).

All web requests are deconstructed into basic sql operations
which are ran by a self implemented 2PL scheduler.

Use cases:
1 - client make order (transaction that modifies stocks and adds a log)
2 - client see available beers (read with available > 0)
3 - admin add a beer (transaction add beerinfo + add stock)
4 - admin see all beers
5 - admin update stock
6 - admin update price

Tables :
- sales log : price, address, description
- beers : description, name, style, producer
- stock : price, availability
